    <h1>Jeremiah's WDD 330 Portfolio: Week 1</h1>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>-Section tags fill the screen all the way across. This can be used for layout purposes.<br>
      LOCAL STORAGE<br>
      - Saving = localStorage.setItem(identifier,valueassociatedwithidentifier)<br>
      -Loading = var value = localStorage.getItem(identifier)<br>
      MOBILE UX<br>
      -Design web apps for the smallest device first<br>
      -1. Be There<br>
      -2. Be Useful (Relevant)<br>
      -3. Be Quick (Simplicity)<br>
      -Reachability- how our users use their device (physically)- design accordingly<br>
      -Lots of people don’t have the top speeds, develop to ensure speed by:<br>
       1.Reduce image usage<br>
       2.SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth<br>
       3.Optimize and minify css and js files<br>
       4.GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data<br>
      -Make the selections larger in forms for ease of selection. Reduce information to the bare necessity. Reduce cognitive load.<br>
      -If you require a lot of information, paginate the form (break it into sections). IF the form is large enough, consider adding a progress bar<br>
      -For passwords, default the passwords to not be hidden, but allow the user to hide it if they desire<br>
      -Use the number pad when the user needs to enter in numbers<br>
      -Link phone numbers so that they don’t have to copy and paste the number to use it<br>
      -Make mobile ads small and simple. Don’t use pop ups<br>
      -Don’t use pop-ups/pop-overs<br>
      -Make the ads unobtrusive, keep your content first<br>

    <h2>Exercises:</h2>
    <a href="storywriter.html">Story Writer - had to make some fixes to the code in the reading to get it to work</a>
    <h2>Questions:</h2> 
    <p>Is localStorage client or server side? I would guess that it is client since it is "local"</p>
    <p>Does it really matter if you start on the smallest screen? If your intention is to make it <br>
    look nice on mobile and desktop, the amount of effort, time, and quality wouldn't change based on <br>
    where you started, I would think.</p>
