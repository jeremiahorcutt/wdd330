    <h1>Jeremiah's WDD 330 Portfolio: Week 1</h1>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>-Section tags fill the screen all the way across. This can be used for layout purposes.<br>
      LOCAL STORAGE<br>
      - Saving = localStorage.setItem(identifier,valueassociatedwithidentifier)<br>
      -Loading = var value = localStorage.getItem(identifier)<br>
      MOBILE UX<br>
      -Design web apps for the smallest device first<br>
      - Was unable to view the remainder of the videos due to the pay wall<br>
      </p>
    <h2>Exercises:</h2>
    <a href="storywriter.html">Story Writer - had to make some fixes to the code in the reading</a>
    <h2>Questions:</h2> 
    <p>Is localStorage client or server side? I would guess that it is client since it is "local"</p>
    <p>Does it really matter if you start on the smallest screen? If your intention is to make it <br>
    look nice on mobile and desktop, the amount of effort, time, and quality wouldn't change based on <br>
    where you started, I would think.</p>
