  Arrow functions<br>
  Main differences to a standard function<br>
  Does not have its own bindings to this or super, and should not be used as methods.<br>
  Does not have arguments, or new.target keywords.<br>
  Not suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.<br>
  Cannot be used as constructors.<br>
  Cannot use yield, within its body.<br>
  // Traditional Function<br>
  function (a){<br>
    return a + 100;<br>
  }<br>
  // Arrow Function Break Down<br>
  // 1. Remove the word "function" and place arrow between the argument and opening body bracket<br>
  (a) => {<br>
    return a + 100;<br>
  }<br>
  // 2. Remove the body brackets and word "return" -- the return is implied.<br>
  (a) => a + 100;<br>
  // 3. Remove the argument parentheses<br>
  a => a + 100;<br>

  Chapter 8: Forms<br>
  The action attribute of a form tag is the URL where the form will be submitted to<br>
  Document.forms returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup<br>
  const form = document.forms[0]; is the same as<br>
   const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];<br>
  A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form<br>
  The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. Note that submitting a form using this method won’t trigger the form submit event<br>
  The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML<br>
  button type='reset'>Reset/button will achieve the same thing as form.reset() but it is considered poor usability since it can’t accidently be clicked<br>
  The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server<br>
  FORM EVENTS:<br>
  Focus- event occurs when an element is focused on<br>
  Blur- event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.<br>
  Change- event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it<br>
  Submit- event occurs when the form is submitted<br>
  <br>
  You can actually stop the form from being submitted to that URL altogether by using the preventDefault() method<br>
  FORM VALIDATION<br>
  A submit button can be disable by added the disabled attribute to the input element: - this will stop a form from <br>
  being submitted if there are any errors. IF using this method, you need to change the attribute via js<br>
  function disableSubmit(event) {<br>
      if(event.target.value === ''){<br>
          document.getElementById('submit').disabled = true;<br>
      } else {<br>
          document.getElementById('submit').disabled = false;<br>
      }<br>
  preventDefault() can also be used to stop a form from submitting.<br>
  In a real application, you might end up having to validate many different elements according to various different rules. <br>
  If this is the case, it would make sense to write some more generic addError() and removeError() functions to deal with the<br>
   different types of validation you might want to apply to the various elements in a form- for vanilla JS<br>

  Chapter 12 – OOP in JS<br>
  Encapsulation-  the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user<br>
  Polymorphism- the same process can be used for different objects<br>
  Inheritance- taking the features of one object then adding some new features<br>
  Constructor function-<br>
  Pascal Notation (first letter of every word is uppercased)<br>
  Function Circle(){<br>
  this.radius = radius;<br>
  this.draw = function(){<br>
  console.log(‘draw’);<br>
  }<br>
  objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that created it<br>
  static methods cannot be called in instances of the object<br>
  <br>
  <br>

  Libraries<br>
  A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common task<br>
  A disadvantage to a library is that it may cause performance issues.<br>
  Modules<br>
  A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules<br>
  Coupling refers to how co-dependent two pieces of code are. Loose coupling is generally better since it makes overall modification easier<br>
  All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.<br>
  A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.<br>
  The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined, rather than the global object.<br>
  You can't use HTML-style comments in modules <br>
  You can import functions from one file to another<br>
  File a:<br>
  Export {<br>
   function<br>
  }<br>
  File b:<br>
  import  { function } from '.fileA.js';<br>
  Default exportsrefer toa singlevariable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named<br>
  Having more than one default export will result in a syntax error.<br>
