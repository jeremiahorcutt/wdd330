      WINDOW OBJECT-------------------------------------<br>
The window object is the global object in a browser.<br>
Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.<br>
alert , confirm() , and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.<br>
The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.<br>
The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.<br>
The window.location object also has the following methods:<br>
The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true , it will force the browser<br> to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.<br>
The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example:<br>
The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.<br>
The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL:<br>
The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.<br>
You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).<br>
The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.<br>
 document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.<br>
Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.<br>
The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.<br>
The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.<br>
<br>
The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics<br> capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.<br>
<br>
APIs------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.<br>
API stands for Application Programming Interface.<br>
A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.<br>
A Browser API can extend the functionality of a web browser.<br>
A Server API can extend the functionality of a web server.<br>
Third party APIs are not built into your browser.<br>
<br>
To use these APIs, you will have to download the code from the Web.<br>
 data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.<br>
The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.<br>
The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:<br>
Information stored isnotshared with the server on every request.<br>
Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).
Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).<br>
Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.<br>
The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.<br>
The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.<br>
Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.<br>
The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.<br>
The audio and video elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback<br> using JavaScript.<br>
Audio and video clips also have a number of events that will fire when they occur, including:<br>
The play event, which fires when the clip starts and when it resumes after a pause.<br>
The pause event, which fires when the clip is paused.<br>
The volumechange event, which fires when the volume is changed.<br>
The loadedmetadata event, which we saw in the note above, and which fires when all the video's metadata has loaded.<br>
The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.<br>
A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.<br>
